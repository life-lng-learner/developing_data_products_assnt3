# Create a plot using plotly
In this section, we will use plot_ly to graph the weight of vehicles against the mpg. The color scheme is based on the number of cylinders.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

plot_ly(data=mtcars,x=mtcars$wt,y=mtcars$mpg,mode="markers",color=as.factor(mtcars$cyl)) %>%
layout(title="Mapping the weight of cars against miles per gallon",xaxis=list(title="Weight (1000 lbs)"),yaxis=list(title="mpg (miles/gallon)"))

```
